Loopwave notes

ENDCAP TEXTURE FIX USE NORMALS - SAMPLE BGD TEX

optiFlow - putting res top right after video cam feed saves on fps

3 things affect spin interaction. Optical flow “flow scale”, level top in feedback opacity, “Spin Intensity” on GLSL Top

Switch Composite TOP in the Feedback to average and increase the Spin Intensity for some fun


Audio drone

Attractor position should maybe move in a loop from hips to head

SeekTarget needs radius? Or is the radius particle.position - attractor.position?


Use compute shader for attractor process? Why does pixel and compute shader look different with how they attract, and which one looks better. Maybe convert pixel into compute and use SharedMemory to speed it up (see Vincent Houze's GLSL workshop from the 2019 TD Summit for details)


Tube spin: color video optiflow vs kinect hip uv pos
if hip position, only people who are detected can spin the tubes which might lead to problems

Should target strength be based on amount of neighbors rather than time in scene?

Notes for better fps

Notes about illustrator, strokes and mask


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Texture errors
Amoeba squiggles outside and loops around
Cells (for black tube esp) don't have a good distance to travel (is the 270,540 hardcoded value based on another tube with cells?)


[x] send tubes far away and then use "active parameter" in instancing to disappear them

tube 15 pattern spins (or hue change based on texcoord?)
tube5,6 static needs to be individualized

interaction error
when it's in cooldown and the same tube is selected, it doesn't trigger the warm up phase in the next loop

does audio 'shuffle1' in "tubes" need to always be cooking or can I use a selective null?

see which tubes are missing statics or any other parts

(maybe) when tube is unwraped and spin is affected by user movement, it should calculate the entire area, right now it's still split up by tube position

some of the repeated patterns (tube 7) should get a hue change for every pattern section

change x grid so there's no cooking TOPs (all contained in GLSL MAT)

Check some texture res sizes are 2050

cell scale: find median, so large cells scale down more and small cells scale up more

Image Output imageoutput - Image Output allows you to read/write arbitrary data to a image2D, image3D etc, GLSL uniform using imageStore() and imageLoad() GLSL. This allows for extra data to be stored/loaded during the render process, to be used later. The uniforms will be named one of these arrays, depending on the type of image output selected mTD2DImageOutputs[], mTD2DArrayImageOutputs[], mTD3DImageOutputs[], mTDCubeImageOutputs[]. Since only one image ouptut is currently supported, index [0] should always be used to access these. The buffer is cleared to 0 before every render.
so inside your pixelshader you can use imageStore(mTD3DImageOutputs[0], ivec3(x,y,z), vec4(yourdata));
then use a renderselect on the renderTOP .. and it will be the first index I think

flock attractor use sdSphere() instead of distance()

if all virus eliminated, trigger inactivity

Virus particle reduction parameter should affect life/active

Infection COMP "instance count" should account for virus/particle reduction

remap pelvis x location to span all tubes, remember to scale it according to tube width. reference averager glsl

frameLoop in the gpu_flock/simParticles is terrible. It's for controlling the noise displacement speed on the virus particles. As attr time goes up, so does the speed (right now 1x-15x). sin() is to disguise the loop. I don't think it's written well
